            prepares for the <span>possibility of pregnancy</span> each month. 
            The menstrual cycle <span>starts</span> on the <span>first day</span>of the menstrual period <span>until</span> 
            the <span>first day</span>of 
            your next menstrual period. The average menstrual cycle lasts <span>28</span>days. Every person’s cycle 
            is slightly <span>different,</span> but the process is the same.

        <p class="follicular-phase_text">At the beginning of the <span>follicular phase</span>, the lining of the uterus (endometrium) is thick with fluids 
            and nutrients designed to nourish an embryo. 
            If no egg has been fertilized, estrogen and progesteron levels are low. As a result, the top layers
             of the endometrium  are shed, and <span>menstrual bleeding</span>, which often times is painful, occurs.
            </p>

        <p class="medical-term_text">The medical term for period pain associated with menstruation is <span>dysmenorrhea</span>. 
            It often begins a few hours before menstruation and persists for 2-3 days, with the pain strongest during the 
            first 24 to 36 hours. The pain a person may feel can very 
            from dull and constant to intense spasms. 
            Dysmenorrhea affects 45 to 95% of people who menstruate.
            </p>
        <p class="dysmenorrhea_text">
            Dysmenorrhea is caused by levels of <span>prostaglandins</span>, which are pain mediators. The number of them increase following the decrease of progesterone.
            Due to prostaglandins, <span>spiral vessels</span>, which supply the uterine lining with blood are no longer supplied with blood. As a result <span>ischemia</span>, which is painful, occurs. 
            The uterus is deprived of blood and reacts by <span>contracting</span> to get rid of the uterine lining that is no longer useful, due to the egg not being fertilized.

        <p class="pituitary-gland_text">About this time, the pituitary gland slightly increases its production of follicle-stimulating hormone. 
            This hormone then stimulates the growth of <span>3 to 30 follicles</span>. Each follicle contains an <span>egg</span>. Later in the 
            phase, as the level of this hormone decreases, only one of
            these follicles (called the <span>dominant follicle</span>) continues to grow.
            It soon begins to produce estrogen, and the other stimulated follicles begin to break down. The increasing
            estrogen
            also begins to prepare the uterus and stimulates
            the luteinizing hormone surge.
            On average, the follicular phase lasts about
            <span>13 or 14 days</span>.
            Of the three phases, this phase
            <span>varies</span>the most in length.
            It tends to become shorter
            near menopause.</p>

    <div class="container_ovulatory-phase">
        <p class="time-for-ovulation-title">t<span>im</span>e for ovulat<span>io</span>n<br><span>...</span>final<span>ly</span></p>

        <p class="ovulation_text">The ovulatory phase begins with a <span>surge</span> in luteinizing hormone 
            and follicle-stimulating hormone levels. Luteinizing hormone 
            stimulates <span>egg release</span> (ovulation), which usually occurs 16 to 32 
            hours after the surge begins.
            The estrogen level <span>decreases</span> during the surge, and the progesterone 
            level starts to increase. The ovulatory phase begins when the level of luteinizing hormone surges. 
            Luteinizing hormone stimulates the dominant follicle to <span>bulge</span> from the surface of the 
            ovary and finally <span>rupture</span>, releasing 
            the egg. 
            The ovulatory phase ends when the egg is released, about <span>10 to 12 hours</span> 
            after the surge in the level of luteinizing hormone. The egg can be <span>fertilized</span>
            for only up to about <span>12 hours</span>after its release.</p>

        <p class="luteal_text">During the <span>luteal phase</span>, which lasts around 14 days, luteinizing hormone 
            and follicle-stimulating hormone levels <span>decrease</span>. During most of this phase, the estrogen level is high.
              Progesterone  and estrogen  cause the lining of the uterus to <span>thicken</span> more, to prepare for possible 
            fertilization. If the egg is not fertilized, the <span>corpus luteum</span> degenerates and no longer produces  progesterone,
             the estrogen level decreases.</p>

            Either way, PMS symptoms 
            disrupt life. The <span>causes</span> of PMS are still unknown. </p>
        
        <p class="PMS-causes_text">It’s possible that <span>hormone changes</span> related to the menstrual cycle cause some people to experience PMS symptoms. 
            Symptoms usually show up <span>after ovulation</span>, when the ovaries release an egg. The estrogen and progesteron levels <span>dip</span> around this time. 
            Symptoms often go away a few days after the period, when hormone levels start to rise again. These <span>hormone fluctuations</span> may be to blame for PMS.</p>
